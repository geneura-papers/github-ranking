    abstract = {{This paper examines the claim that libre (free, open source) software involves global development. The anecdotal evidence is that developers usually work in teams including individuals residing in many different geographical areas, time zones and even continents and that, as a whole, the libre software community is also diverse in terms of national origin. However, its exact composition is difficult to capture, since there are few records of the geographical location of developers. Past studies have been based on surveying a limited (and sometimes biased) sample and extrapolating that sample to the global distribution of developers. In this paper we present an alternate approach in which databases are analyzed to create traces of information from which the geographical origin of developers can be inferred. Applying this technique to the SourceForge users database and the mailing lists archives from several large projects, we have estimated the geographical origin of more than one million individuals who are closely related to the libre software development process. The paper concludes that the result is a good proxy for the actual distribution of libre software developers working on global projects.}},

Based on data from the SourceForge Research Data Archive, the authors exploit information about developers' IP address, email address, and indicated time-zone. This enables them to assign 94\% of all registered users in 2006. As proxy for activity the authors use information about the number of posted messages. Thus they provide a detailed picture of the world-wide allocation of OSS activities. Such country data about the supply-side of OSS is a valuable stock for both cross-country studies on OSS and country-specific research and policy advice.}},

    abstract = {{Weblogs are dynamic websites updated via easy-to-use content management systems and organized as a set of chronologically ordered stories, frequently built around a link or including links to other weblogs. Since they are managed by individuals, their links tend to mirror or, in some cases, establish new types of social relations, thereby creating a social network. Studying the evolution of this network allows the discovery of emerging social structures and their growth trends. In this paper, we demonstrate the advantages of using the self-organizing maps (SOM) to visualize the evolution of a social network formed by a set of blogs, from their beginning to their current state. By observing the position a weblog is mapped to, it is easy to see what communities it belongs to nowadays, and how and when it became a part of those communities. The proposed procedure gives some insight on how communities are formed and have evolved. In this study, we apply this method to Blogalia, a blog-hosting site from which we have obtained a complete set of data and, by using SOM projections, we have drawn some conclusions on what drives the evolution of its implicit social network.}},

The technologies were: blogging, audio conferencing, instant messaging and Harvard's Rotisserie system. Each of the technologies is addressed, and details from the student evaluation are provided. The student feedback on all the technologies was positive. The role of the learning object based course design is examined and it is suggested that this approach facilitates the incorporation of innovative technologies into a course. The authors suggest that as students become increasingly accustomed to standard communication tools such as asynchronous bulletin boards, there will be a shift towards implementing a range of technologies, each offering particular affordances for different forms of communication.},
